*Preliminary draft available*

Most African students were taught in the colonial language at the independence. The vast majority of African countries have addressed the issue by changing the Language of Instruction (LoI) in primary education through official laws, replacing the colonial language with a local one. However, little is known about these linguistic policies' context and long-term effects. This paper proposes a data-driven cross-country comparison of all linguistic policies targeting LoI to highlight some stylized facts about the political and linguistic context surrounding the reforms, using a novel dataset on linguistic reforms in Africa. Past and present political features seem to matter when explaining the extensive margin. Using micro-data on eighteen African countries, I provide descriptive aggregated evidence on the effect of these bilingual education reforms. Results suggest that schooling and learning increase with the introduction of local languages in education, especially for women and students who have finished primary education.

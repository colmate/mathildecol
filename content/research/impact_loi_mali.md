**Ongoing working project**

There is little to no rigorous evidence of impacts of nationwide policies introducing local languages in primary schools on education and labor outcomes. I use the progressive extension of bilingual education in the early 2000 to document the impact of bilingual education on education and labour market outcomes using a DID design. Using census data and archives on the policy extension, I find positive effects on learning and schooling. Early results show that people exposed to bilingual education in their language are more likely to hold a public job and not an agricultural one. Thiese findings are driven by women, people with longer schooling and happen especially in rural areas. All of this is consistent with the qualitative and quantitve literature on the topic.
